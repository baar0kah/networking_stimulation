Tool Used: Cisco Packet Tracer



Project Overview

This project simulates a secure branch office network for a mid-sized financial services company.

The network is segmented using VLANs, routed with Router-on-a-Stick, and secured using

Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) and SSH for device management.




Key Features

\- VLAN segmentation for Administration, Sales, and IT departments

\- Inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick

\- Extended ACLs enforcing least-privilege access

\- Secure remote access using SSH

\- Telnet disabled for improved security
